1. When would you use a weak entity?

We would use a weak entity where there is a parent-child relationship between entities and the
child cannot exist without there being a parent. Here the context of knowing that the child relates
to a parent reduces the amount of key information required to uniquely identify a child entity. The required child key information includes a reference to the parent and a unique identification of the
child in the context of the parent.


2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?

Use entities where:
The object is of direct interest to the database.
The object has components.
The object can have multiple instances.
The object is often nonexistent or unknown.

Use attributes where:
The object is not of direct interest to the database.
The object does not have components.
The object does not have multiple instances.
The object is often existent and known. 



3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store 
compilations, where a compilation is an album that contains tracks by two 
or more different artists.

See Question3.jpg or Question3.vsd (Diagram is in Visio ER format which is a modified version of 
Chen's ER format).

4. Create an ER diagram for an online media store using the following requirements:
 - There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
 - Customers can buy any number of each product.
 - For each CD, store the title, the artist’s name, the label (publisher), 
   and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) 
   of each track on the CD.
 - For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 contain some sample data to help you better understand 
the requirements.

Table 4-1. Video DVDs
Title			Studio			Price
Leon—The Professional	Sony Pictures		$21.99
Chicken Run		Dreamworks Video	$19.99

Table 4-2. Music CDs
Title	Artist	Label	Price
Come Away With Me	Norah Jones	Blue Note Records	$11.99
Feels Like Home		Norah Jones	Blue Note Records	$11.99
The Joshua Tree		U2		Island			$10.99
Brothers in Arms	Dire Straits 	Vertigo			 $9.99

Table 4-3 contains a sample list of music CD track titles and length in 
seconds for the CD with the title “Come Away With Me” by the artist 
Norah Jones.

If you are using Visio, Mike Murphy points out that there is a stencil by 
Daniel Harris that worked for him at 
http://www.visiocafe.com/downloads/various/DanielHarris/Chen_ER.zip

This directory also contains a Diagram4_11.odg file with Diagram 4-11, for use in question 3, and
as a model for question 4.
The .odg file was created on Open Office, but all compatibile programs can be seen at:
http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/odg

Or you can just hand-draw diagrams for questions 3 and 4 and take a picture, as in the Diagram4_11.jpg file.
