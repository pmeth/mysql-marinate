Q1. When would you use a weak entity?

   One would use a weak entity to represent an entity that cannot be uniquely
   identified by its attributes alone.

   A weak entity requires additional attributes, typically in the form of one
   (or more) foreign key(s) to uniquely identify it in the context of the
   overall database.

   In the folowing simple example, the childA and childB entities are weak
   entities, each requiring a (foreign key) attribute from the strong parent
   entity to generate the primary key for each child entity key.

         +--------+
      +--> parent <--+
      |  +--------+  |
      |              |
   +--+-----+     +--+-----+
   | childA |     | childB |
   +--------+     +--------+


Q2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?

   Typically, it is better to use entities instead of attributes, but you
   should ask yourself the following questions regarding the nature of the
   object before making the final decision:

   If the object is of direct interest to the database, it should be an entity.
   And any information that describes it should be stored in attributes of
   that entity.

   If the object has components of its own, we must find a way of representing
   those components; a separate entity might be the best solution.

   If the object can have multiple instances, we must find a way to store
   data on each instance. The cleanest way to do this is to represent the
   object as a separate entity.

   If the object is often nonexistent or unknown, it is effectively an
   attribute of only some of the entities, and it would be better to model
   it as a separate entity rather than as an attribute that is often empty.

Q3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store
    compilations, where a compilation is an album that contains tracks by two
    or more different artists.

Q4. Create an ER diagram for an online media store using the following
    requirements:

   o There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
   o Customers can buy any number of each product.
   o For each CD, store the title, the artistâ€™s name, the label (publisher),
     and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) of
     each track on the CD.
   o For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.
