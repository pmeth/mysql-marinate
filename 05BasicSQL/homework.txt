All exercises here concern the music database, which is available at

I strongly recommend ANSI join style as per 
http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-joins-on-vs-using-vs-theta-style - 
the nutshell is that Theta style is like this:

SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 
WHERE field1=field2 AND filter=something;

ANSI style is like this:
SELECT ... 
FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON (field1=field2) 
WHERE filter=something;

The reason for this is that when you have many tables joined 
it's easier to see the join clause in ON or USING with ANSI style. 
If you join many tables and use theta style, where everything is 
in the WHERE clause, it's possible to forget some of the join clauses 
in the WHERE. If you put the join clauses in the JOIN part, it's way more readable.

1) Use one or more SELECT statements to find out how many tracks are on New Order's Brotherhood album.

SELECT AR.artist_name, AL.album_name, T.track_name 
FROM artist AR
JOIN album AL
ON AR.artist_id=AL.artist_id
JOIN track T
ON AR.artist_id=T.artist_id AND AL.album_id=T.album_id 
WHERE AR.artist_name='New Order' AND AL.album_name='Brotherhood';

Answer = 10 tracks

2) Using a join, list the albums that we own by the band New Order

SELECT AR.artist_name, AL.album_name 
FROM artist AR
JOIN album AL
ON AR.artist_id=AL.artist_id
WHERE AR.artist_name='New Order';

3) With INSERT statements, add the artist Leftfield to the database. 
For this new artist, add the album "Leftism" that has the following tracks:
a. Release the Pressure (Time: 7.39)
b. Afro-Melt (Time: 7.33)
c. Melt (Time: 5.21)
d. Song of Life (Time: 6.55)
e. Original (Time: 6.00)
f. Black Flute (Time: 3.46)
g. Space Shanty (Time: 7.15)
h. Inspection Check One (Time: 6.30)
i. Storm 3000 (Time: 5.44)
j. Open Up (Time: 6.52)
k. 21st Century Poem (Time: 5.42)
l. Bonus Track (Time: 1.22)

The answer to this question should be the INSERT statement(s).

INSERT INTO artist VALUES(7, "Leftfield");

INSERT INTO album VALUES(7, 1, "Leftism");

INSERT INTO track 
(track_id, track_name, artist_id, album_id, time)
VALUES
(1, "Release the Pressure", 7, 1, 7.39),
(2, "Afro-Melt", 7, 1, 7.33),
(3, "Melt", 7, 1, 5.21),
(4, "Song of Life", 7, 1, 6.55),
(5, "Original", 7, 1, 6.00),
(6, "Black Flute", 7, 1, 3.46),
(7, "Space Shanty", 7, 1, 7.15),
(8, "Inspection Check One", 7, 1, 6.30),
(9, "Storm 3000", 7, 1, 5.44),
(10, "Open Up", 7, 1, 6.52),
(11, "21st Century Poem ", 7, 1, 5.42),
(12, "Bonus Track", 7, 1, 1.22);

4) How long in minutes is the Leftism album you added in Question 3? Hint: use the
SUM() aggregate function.

SELECT SUM(time) FROM track
WHERE artist_id=7 AND album_id=1;

Answer=67.99

5) Change the time for the Original track on the Leftism album to 6.22.

UPDATE track
SET time=6.22
WHERE track_name="Original" AND artist_id=7 AND album_id=1;

6) Remove the 'Bonus Track' from the Leftism album,

DELETE track
WHERE track_name="Bonus Track" AND artist_id=7 AND album_id=1;
