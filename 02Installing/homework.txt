Homework for Chapter 2 of Learning MySQL (2006 edition), from p. 94:

Exercises:
1) What is command completion?

- Command completion is a feature that allows you to cycle through command / files / directory names in the command prompt by hitting the Tab key.

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install", or compiled methods?

 - Installing with a package means that everything will be installed together in a consisten fashion

 - A no install archive is useful if you don't have administrator access on the computer being used

 - Using the compiled method allows select features to be chosen when installing

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

- This can be done by comparing checksums generated by a digest algorithm such as MD5

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?

- In Windows this is done by either running the MySQL server configuration program and selecting "Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH" checkbox or manually add it by changing the Environment Variables

Additional Exercises (not in the book): 
1) Document how you installed MySQL and any issues you came across with installation. 
 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)

 - I installed MySQL as part of XAMPP

2) Document where important files should be.
