Q1. What is command completion?
A   Command completion is a feature of *nix based shells and Windows command
    shell to expand any initial text a user has entered into full or partial
    pathnames that begin with the text the user entered.

    For example, on a Linux machine with bash, if I enter the following
     command sequence:

       ls -l /bin/ba<TAB>

    the bash shell will expand it to:

       ls -l /bin/bash

    using <TAB> as the command completion sequence.

    Command completion allows the user to enter a minimal number of
    characters, followed by the completion sequence to complete a
    command.

Q2. What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
    directory archive (tarball or “no-install”), or compiled methods?
A   Some of the advantages are:

    o Installing MySQL using a package typically installs the mysql support
      programs, server and database data files in a standard location:

      - support programs are typically installed in /usr/bin
      - the server is typically installed in /usr/libexec/mysqld
      - database file are typically installed in /var/lib/mysql

    o Installing MySQL from an archive allows a non-privileged user to
      install and run the software in parallel with a running production
      database or the the pre-installed system version.

      This parallel installation of the database server would have to use
      a different unix socket (or named pipe on windows systems) and/or
      a different network port if it's being accessed from a network-based
      client.
    o The compiled method allows the user to customize those features they
      believe they (do not) require.

      A mysql server bundled in a package or binary tar ball will have
      been pre-compiled by someone other than yourself.

      Consequently, it may lack some of the features that you require or
      be overly bloated with features that you do not require. A mysql
      server that is bloated with unncessary features will run slower on
      the server machine and consume more of its resources than you had
      forseen.
      
Q3. How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?
A3  Verify that the md5 sum of the package you downloaded matches the md5
    sum provided on the download web site

Q4. How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?
A   Modifying the command search path.

    In bash on *nix based systems, this would be:

    PATH=/MySQL/BIN/DIRECTORY:$PATH export PATH
