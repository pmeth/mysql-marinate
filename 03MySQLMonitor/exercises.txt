Client-Server architecture mainly consist of two components client and server where client requests for a service 
and the server does that service for the client. A server can serve multiple clients whereas multiple clients 
can send request to a single server.

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. In interactive mode, we only can run queries one by one. But in batch mode we can run a set of queries from external
source in a particular order. The query set in batch mode is reusable. 


4. user(-u) option accepts the username to connect to mysql server.
  password (-p) option accepts the password for the user
  database option accepts the database name to be connected

altogether we use the following command to connect to a mysql server in localhost.
 mysql -u abdur -p test_db
