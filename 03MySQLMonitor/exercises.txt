1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

The client and the server are separate processes that can run on the same or separate machines. The client connects to the server and makes requests of the server. The server provides responses to the client.The server can service requests coming from a set of authorized clients.


2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/subqueries.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o Starting in MySQL 5.6.2, SELECT supports explicit partition selection
  using the PARTITION keyword with a list of partitions or
  subpartitions (or both) following the name of the table in a
  table_reference (see [HELP JOIN]). In this case, rows are selected
  only from the partitions listed, and any other partitions of the
  table are ignored. For more information and examples, see
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/partitioning-selection.html.

  In MySQL 5.6.6 and later, SELECT ... PARTITION from tables using
  storage engines such as MyISAM that perform table-level locks (and
  thus partition locks) lock only the partitions or subpartitions named
  by the PARTITION option.

  See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/partitioning-limitations-locki
  ng.html, for more information.

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary)
  functions. See
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/expressions.html, and
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?

In interactive mode you key in SQL Queries or MySQL Commands one by one and get results.
In batch mode the monitor reads in a list of commands from a text file which it then executes.


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

The monitor user, password and database options are used to authenticate the user and to verity
that the user is authorized to carry out the request on the target database.
