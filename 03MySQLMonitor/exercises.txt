1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

A: It means that the whole data is stored into a server and you have many kind of clients that access the data. The client can have access to reading and writting or read-only access. Some common clients: sequelpro, mysql, sqllite, etc.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (We’ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)
If you are trying to calculate stats, looking under a specific view, or even grabbing some data under some criteria, than you should use the select statement. It's going to help select a part of the whole database for your need.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using
the monitor in batch mode?
The monitor in interative mode you past your query/command/list of command in the command line.
The batch mode you load/run queries stored in a file.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?
To access a server you need to specify a user and the password is optional, but even for no set password, your must leave the field empty $mysql --user = abacate --password.
If you are the only user, than you may have a password, and you have access for everthing in the server (delete, write, select, update, etc), otherwise, the access is setting up in a user table in the server.
This user and password has no relation to the user that the application is running under (on linux and mac os application runs under a user) or your computer username.
If you set it up a user, you can choose whatever the acces that this user is going to have in your server.

Database option helps you on don't have to type the database name everytime that you run a command/list of command.
I prefer don't use this option because I'm used to using join all the time, so in this case I fell confortable writting down the name of db every time that I run a query to make sure that I'm running the right way.
